7.1 Deck Of Cards

  CardObjects have two pieces of data
    rank
    suit

    in python we can use some dunder methods to make syntax nice

    for example we want to be able to say two_of_hearts < three_of_hearts because two of hearts is a lower rankA

  DeckObjects
    deck objects under the hood are a queue of cards.  We can feel safe representing a deck this way since card games made with physical cards tend to follow this model exactly
    it shoudl have a shuffle method
    it shoudl have visibility methods
    it should have a draw method that draws n cards

    you should be anle to init it as with or without jokers or short deck.

    In blackjack case you  might want to increase the number of decks used

  HandObjects
    HandObjects are reprsented as a dynamic array
    they may have associated metadata depending on the game when subclassed
    the base class does basic things like swap cards, remove cards

  Game Objects compose these together.  We don't subclass because inheritence is death
